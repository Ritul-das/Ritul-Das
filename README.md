## 🧠 About Me

I am a literature student with a strong interest in technology, creative problem-solving, and digital design. I enjoy blending **analytical thinking** with **creative expression**, whether that’s through code, UI/UX design, or structured writing. My academic background in literature strengthens my communication skills, narrative thinking, and attention to detail—qualities I actively apply to software development and project design.

I am continuously learning and building projects to improve my technical skills and create meaningful, user-focused solutions.
